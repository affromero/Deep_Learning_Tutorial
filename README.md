# CNN and FCN Tutorials

These tutorials are exclusively made for the *1st IEEE Signal Processing Society Winter School on Image and Video Analysis* (SPSWSIVA 2018), which is held in Medellín from 19-22 February.

These codes support the **Dr. Pablo Arbelaez**' talk on Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) and Semantic Segmentation frameworks (Feb 22).

**Andrés Felipe Romero** is in charge of this practical tutorial. 

----
## Requirements
- Python 2.7 or higher
- **CNN tutorial**: Tensorflow 1.5.0 - *Although it would work in older versions*
- **FCN tutorial**: Pytorch 0.2 or higher

## Tip
Use this commit `e8e0197` to see the expected training outputs (mostly for **FCN** since **CNN** is not time consuming).
